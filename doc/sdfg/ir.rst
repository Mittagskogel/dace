Stateful Dataflow multiGraphs (SDFG)
====================================

Philosophy
----------

data-centric vs. control-centric


differentiate between scopes and data-centric "scopes"
differentiate between read/write/update
differentiate between symbols and scalars

The Language
------------

with pictures


Elements
~~~~~~~~

all the IR elements


Data Containers and Access Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data container types: array/scalar/stream.

See :class:`~dace.data.Array` for how it is allocated and how to customize this behavior.

Transient property, aliasing assumptions.

Views and references, see below.


Memlets
~~~~~~~

anatomy of a memlet


Symbols
~~~~~~~~
Scalars vs. symbols


Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~

Connectors have types.

Image with tasklet connectors (which are used in the tasklet), side by side with a map with two input connectors
and two input edges, and three output edges. Three of them marked in orange and the connector names are shown. 

Mention *memlet paths* and the general *memlet tree* that can go through arbitrary scopes


Parametric Parallelism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Map consume
schedule types


Dynamic Map Ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explain + example (image / embedded viewer)


Views and References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
view/reference

Use reference sparingly.


SDFG Builder API
----------------

``add_node`` etc.


What to Avoid
-------------

SDFGs are Turing complete. However, not everything can be represented concisely.

Parametric-depth recursion for example (could potentially make a stack, but will be slow)

References with different sizes (dynamic pointers etc.)

DaCe Frontends try to encapsulate those away


.. _format:

``.sdfg`` File Format
---------------------

An SDFG file is a JSON file that contains all the properties of the graph's elements. See :ref:`properties` for more
information about how those are saved.

You can save an SDFG to a file in the SDFG API with the :func:`~dace.sdfg.sdfg.SDFG.save` method. Loading an SDFG from a
file uses the :func:`~dace.sdfg.sdfg.SDFG.from_file` static method. For example, in the following save/load roundtrip:

.. code-block:: python

    @dace.program
    def example(a: dace.float64[20]):
        return a + 1
    sdfg = example.to_sdfg()  # Create an SDFG out of the DaCe program

    sdfg.save('myfile.sdfg')  # Save
    new_sdfg = dace.SDFG.from_file('myfile.sdfg')  # Reload

    assert sdfg.hash_sdfg() == new_sdfg.hash_sdfg()  # OK, SDFGs are the same


The ``compress`` argument can be used to save a smaller (``gzip`` compressed) file. It can keep the same extension,
but it is customary to use ``.sdfg.gz`` or ``.sdfgz`` to let others know it is compressed.
